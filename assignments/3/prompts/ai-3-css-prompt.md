I need your help generating a css stylesheet file with the following html file.

Now here is what wand the general design to look like:

Font Style: New Century Schoolbook 

Design Elements 
- Each section gets its own separate flexbox (Nav, Header, About, Skills, Projects, Contact) 
- Center the headers but do not center the p tags or any lists (ul tags)

Color Scheme (in HEX codes): 
- 157A6E (Pine Green - mainly used for Text) 
- 499F68 (Shamrock Green - can be used for flexbox border) 
- 77B28C (Cambridge Blue can be used for border color for the photo) 
- C2C5BB (Ash Gray - mainly used for the flexboxes, make it just a tad bit transparent) 
- B4654A (Brown Sugar - mainly used for the top Navigation Bar)
